# Food Security Technical Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that explore datasets and APIs related to the food security and climate change. The notebooks in this folder are what we used to familiarize ourselves with this data and explore how to work with the various APIs.

The notebooks cover a range of topics, including food availability, access to food. They also analyze data from various sources, such as government and non-governmental organizations. Additionally, the notebooks demonstrate how to use different APIs to access and manipulate data, making it easy for users to replicate the analyses and use the code for their own research. We hope the notebooks in this folder are a helpful resource for understanding some of the data related to food security.
